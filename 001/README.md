# 001
## Difficulty
I don't think this is so difficult to decipher.
But it may be troublesome.
It's not easy, I think.

I may upload more ciphertext so that you can decipher it more easily.

I recommend that you try to break the code without a hint,
especially hint 2.

## To those who broke this code
I forgot all the letters were capital letters.

The letters of the password are all small letters.
