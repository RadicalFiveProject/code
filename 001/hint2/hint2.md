# Hint 2
## Frequency analysis
The plaintext is written in English.

## Vigen√®re cipher
This cipher is not a simple substitution cipher,
but you can use the same method to break it.

## hint2.py
Of course you can do it by hand, but I think
you definitely want to use a software or write a program.

I implemented a script in Python that performs the method.
It's in the same directory.
The file name is `hint.py`
If you don't know what or how to do, you can use it.
Note that Matplotlib is required to run the script.
