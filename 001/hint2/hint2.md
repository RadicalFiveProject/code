# Hint 2
## Frequency analysis
The plaintext is written in English.

## Vigenère cipher
You can use the same method of deciphering Vigenère ciphers to break it.

## hint2.py
Of course you can do it by hand, but I think
you definitely want to use a software or write a program.

I implemented a script in Python that performs the method.

It's in the same directory, and the file name is `hint2.py`

If you don't know what or how to do or just don't want to do it, you can use this script.

Note that Matplotlib is required to run the script.
