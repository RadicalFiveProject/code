# 002
The pixels of `x.ppm` is scrambled by a certain algorithm.

## If you think you solved the problem,
See solved/solved.md

## Note
In 002, you have to handle Netpbm formats.

If you use Python 3, you can use a simple (but incomplete)
library written by me,
which can load and save those formats of image files.

The file name is `pnm.py`.

Of course you can use other languages and libraries,
and even write a new library from scratch as I did.

## Difficulty
It looks easy.
