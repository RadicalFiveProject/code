# Enjoy breaking the code
I am making problems about cryptography to enjoy learning it.

Although I try to make interesting problems, I am just a amateur,
so please don't expect high quality problems!

## Difficulty
There are currently (as of 2019-12-11) three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Hard.

This may change in the future.

These levels are based on my skills, so some people think an Easy problem very hard,
and vice versa.

Here is a table that shows the levels of published problems.

| Problem No. | Difficulty |
|:-----------:|:----------:|
| 001         | Normal     |
