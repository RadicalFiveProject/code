# Enjoy breaking the code
## Welcome!
I am making problems about cryptography to enjoy learning it.

Although I try to make interesting problems, I am just a amateur,
so please don't expect high quality ones!

If you want more sophisticated ones, I recommend that you participate in CTF.

## Difficulty
There are currently (as of 2019-12-21) three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Hard.

This may change in the future.

These levels are based on my skills, so some people may think an Easy problem very hard,
and vice versa.

## Problem list
The following table shows the levels of published problems.

| Problem No. | Difficulty |
|:-----------:|:----------:|
| 001         | Normal     |
| 002         | Normal     |
| 003         | Easy       |
| 004         | -          |
| 005         | Hard       |

## Japanese version
READMEs named `*.ja.md` are written in Japanese.

I try to write documents in English,
but there must be many mistakes in the sentences.
察してください.
